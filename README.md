# gitlab-upm-proxy

## Overview

**gitlab-upm-proxy** is a lightweight proxy server that bridges **Unity Package Manager (UPM)** and **GitLab Package Registry (npm)**.

This application forwards selected GitLab API and npm registry endpoints while:

- Using **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for authentication
- Acting as a transparent proxy (no package re-hosting)
- Rewriting `tarball` URLs so Unity can download packages through this proxy
- Supporting Unity-compatible access to **group-scoped** and **project-scoped** GitLab npm endpoints

The primary goal is to enable **Unity to consume private GitLab-hosted UPM packages** without complex client-side authentication or Verdaccio-like registries.

## Authentication

- Authentication is performed using **GitLab Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**
- Tokens are forwarded as-is to GitLab (`PRIVATE-TOKEN` or `Authorization` headers)
- The proxy itself does not manage users or sessions

---

## Forwarded / Supported Endpoints

The proxy accepts GitLab-style URLs and forwards them to the upstream GitLab instance.  
Only the endpoints required for Unity Package Manager operation are supported.

### Supported Endpoints

| Incoming Endpoint (Proxy) | Purpose | Response Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET /api/v4/groups/:groupEnc/-/v1/search | Package search (Unity-compatible) | JSON (npm search v1-like) | Calls GitLab Groups Packages API and reformats the response |
| GET /api/v4/groups/:groupEnc/<any> | Package metadata & registry access | JSON / Binary | Used when Unity treats the group root as the registry URL |
| GET /api/v4/projects/:projectId/packages/npm/<any> | Tarball download (project-level) | Binary (`.tgz`) | Required because GitLab npm tarballs are project-scoped |

### Notes

- No standalone implementation is provided for `/-/whoami` or `/-/all`
  - These endpoints are handled via transparent passthrough if requested
- The proxy does **not** cache packages
- All authorization and permission checks are enforced by GitLab

---

## Typical Use Case

1. Unity is configured with a **Scoped Registry**
2. The registry URL points to this proxy
3. Unity sends search, metadata, and tarball requests
4. The proxy forwards requests to GitLab with the provided PAT
5. GitLab responses are returned with minimal transformation

---

## Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.example.com  
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://upm.example.com
